# Empatica Flutter plugin

Flutter plugin for the [Empatica E4](http://e4.empatica.com/e4-wristband)
wristband on Android. iOS coming soon.

## Install (Flutter)

Add `empatica_e4link` as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml` or run `flutter pub add
empatica_e4link`
For help on adding as a dependency, view the [pubspec documenation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

## Android

The package uses your location and bluetooth to fetch data from the eSense ear plugs.
Therefore location tracking and bluetooth must be enabled.

Add the following entry to your `manifest.xml` file, in the Android project of your application:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="true"/>
```

Also make sure to obtain permissions in your app to use location and bluetooth.
See the example app on how to e.g. use the [`permission_handler`](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) for this. Note that the plugin **does not** handle permissions - this has to be done on an app level.

Set the Android compile and minimum SDK versions to `compileSdkVersion 33`,
and `minSdkVersion 28` respectively, inside the `android/app/build.gradle` file.

## iOS

Due to compatibility issues with Empatica's SDK, the iOS implementation is not able to function with new CocoaPods and iPhone architectures.

## Usage

The Empatica E4 Flutter plugin has been designed to resemble the Android
Empatica API almost **1:1**. Hence, you should be able to recognize the names
of the different classes and class variables.
For example, the methods on the `EmpaticaDeviceManager` class is mapped 1:1.
See the [Empatica Android documentation](https://developer.empatica.com/empatica-android-sdk-javadoc.zip) on how it all works.

However, one major design change has been done; this Empatica Flutter plugin complies to the Dart/Flutter reactive programming architecture using [Stream](https://api.dart.dev/dart-async/Stream-class.html)s.
Hence, you do not get callbacks to an Empatica device (as you do in Java) -- rather, you obtain a Dart stream and listen to this stream (and exploit all the [other very nice stream operations](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams) which are available in Dart).
Below, we shall describe how to use the Empatica streams.
But first -- let's see how to set up and connect to an Empatica E4 device in the first place.

### Setting up and Connecting to an Empatica Device

All operations on the Empatica device happens via the `Empatica plugin`

At first one must connect to the Empatica backend via an API key given by
Empatica using the `authenticateWithAPIKey` method.

```dart
import 'package:empatica_e4link/empatica.dart';

...

// create a device manager that will handle method calls
EmpaticaPlugin deviceManager = EmpaticaPlugin();

await deviceManager
              .authenticateWithAPIKey('your api key goes ');

...

// first listen to status events before trying to connect
deviceManager.statusEventSink?.listen((event) async {
      switch (event.runtimeType) {
        case UpdateStatus:
          //the status of the device manager
          print((event as UpdateStatus).status)
          break;
        case DiscoverDevice:
          await deviceManager.connectDevice((event as DiscoverDevice).device);
          break;
      }
    });

// when status is READY we can start scanning for devices
await deviceManager.startScanning();

```

Everything with the Empatica API happens asynchronously. Hence, the `connectDevice` call merely initiates the connection
process. In order to know the status of the device manager, you should listen to
status events `statusEventSink`.
This is done via the `statusEventSink` stream.
Note, that if you want to know if your connection to the device is successful, you should initiate listening
**before** the connection is initiated, as shown above.

### Listen to physiological data

When the status is `CONNECTED` the device will be sending all data events to
`dataEventSink`. To get _ALL_ data one should start listening on this stream
before it is connected, e.g. when the status is `CONNECTING`.

```dart
deviceManager.dataEventSink?.listen((event) {
      switch (event.runtimeType) {
        // update each data point with the appropriate data
        case ReceiveBVP:
          event as ReceiveBVP;
          break;
```

The possible data events are
| dataEventSink |
|---------------------|
| ReceiveBVP |
| ReceiveGSR |
| ReceiveIBI |
| ReceiveTemperature |
| ReceiveAcceleration |
| ReceiveBatteryLevel |
| ReceiveTag |
| UpdateOnWristStatus |

### Android

The Gradle task useAar in ./android has to be run for the Empatica SDK to be
modeled and used in the Android code.
